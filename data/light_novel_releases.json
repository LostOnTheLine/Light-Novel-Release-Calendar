As far as he\u2019s concerned, trouble always follows the protagonist in a story\u2014so he\u2019s making sure he\u2019s not even a side character. He\u2019s gonna be just an NPC.\n\nDespite his short, portly frame, swarms of beautiful, strong, statuesque women approach John as he drifts through the galaxy. They\u2019re only interested in working with or dueling him, though, and only because he happens to be one of the best pilots out there. John does his best to avoid the women and stay under the radar. After all, more attention means more trouble!\n\nPirates hiding in asteroids, space opera pastiche, and humorous misunderstandings abound in this high-flying series!",

    "description": "Andou Jurai is a second-year highschooler with the mind of an eighth-grade edgelord. His self-indulgent fantasies and over the top antics make him a constant pain in the neck for his friends in the literary club...until, that is, they all suddenly awaken to spectacular supernatural powers! Their godlike abilities include stopping time, manipulating the elements, creating matter from nothing, subverting the very laws of reality, and...producing black fire that doesn\u2019t burn. (Some superpowers are more godlike than others.)\n\nAndou\u2019s read enough comics to know what comes next: it\u2019s only a matter of time before they\u2019ll be dragged into life-or-death battles with the fate of the world itself at stake! The world, however, disagrees. There are no villains, no battles, no earth-shattering disasters\u2014nothing whatsoever. Half a year later, the literary club finds themselves confronting a new question: what do you do with supernatural powers when your day to day life is as commonplace as ever?",

However, as soon as he enters the world of the game, he finds that his sisters have played a trick: he\u2019s been transformed into a girl with the cringy name Kizuna\u2020Exceed.\nBut instead of letting it get to him, he decides to chill and take this new life as it comes.\nWithout sparing a fraction of a second deciding, Kizuna immediately chooses to fish rather than fight on the front lines in this fantasy world. Alongside his sisters, Kanade and Tsumugi, a Japanese-style beauty named Shouko, Yamikage the fake ninja, and other quirky comrades, he works to enjoy his second life to the fullest.",

After spending years traveling across the world, saving towns, defeating demons, and then finally killing the demon king, my party\u2014the people I considered comrades\u2014decided to kick me out. I\u2019d honestly thought that they\u2019d be different. They wouldn\u2019t be like the rest of the world, who irrationally hate people like me, with Amber Eyes. But...I was wrong. \n\nIn the end, it\u2019s not their fault, though. It\u2019s just how the world was back then. I was sure that with more time and understanding, the world would shed their preconceived notions about those with Amber Eyes and treat us as they would anyone else. I held on to this hope as I used my unique magecraft to reincarnate myself two hundred years into the future. Now, it\u2019s time to find out if my guess was right!",

Now, a thousand years later, all he wants is to get a nice, cushy job as a civil official and build a quiet life for himself. Too bad that he still has fighting prowess he can\u2019t explain.

    "description": "Andou Jurai is a second-year highschooler with the mind of an eighth-grade edgelord. His self-indulgent fantasies and over the top antics make him a constant pain in the neck for his friends in the literary club...until, that is, they all suddenly awaken to spectacular supernatural powers! Their godlike abilities include stopping time, manipulating the elements, creating matter from nothing, subverting the very laws of reality, and...producing black fire that doesn\u2019t burn. (Some superpowers are more godlike than others.)\n\nAndou\u2019s read enough comics to know what comes next: it\u2019s only a matter of time before they\u2019ll be dragged into life-or-death battles with the fate of the world itself at stake! The world, however, disagrees. There are no villains, no battles, no earth-shattering disasters\u2014nothing whatsoever. Half a year later, the literary club finds themselves confronting a new question: what do you do with supernatural powers when your day to day life is as commonplace as ever?",

Four years later, she\u2019s managed to carve out a niche for herself\u2014as a housekeeping mage.\n\nAlec is an A-rank adventurer, just returned from a long-term assignment. When his friend Zack, the local Guild Master, tempts him into going on a manticore hunt by promising to bring in a mage with special skills, what Alec finds is the last thing he could have expected.\n\nOn the outside, the two couldn\u2019t be more different. Yet deep in their hearts, they each yearn for the same thing: a place to belong. In the face of old wounds, their dark pasts, and the everyday challenges any adventurer must overcome, will they find the courage to risk being hurt again?",

    "description": "As a holy princess born with divine powers, Mil spends her days blessing adventurers from all across the kingdom. Inspired by their tales of dragons, demons, and treasure-filled dungeons, she has long dreamed of someday setting out on an adventure of her own. But she\u2019s destined for an uneventful life confined to her father\u2019s castle.\n\nThat is, until she\u2019s kidnapped by the Demon King and forced to use her powers to aid his forces instead! Unfortunately the novelty soon wears off, and life imprisoned in the Demon King\u2019s Castle turns into another dull routine. It seems Mil\u2019s only hope to escape the monotony is to somehow grow strong enough to break free and evade her captor.\n\nIn a castle filled with demonic combat instructors, cursed weapons, and tomes of evil spells, Mil\u2019s development is going to be far from holy, but that\u2019s not about to stop her. She\u2019s determined to have the adventure she has always longed for, even if it means mastering forbidden magic!Age rating12+",
